This is the third project and also the first project that will be built completely from the ground up from The Odin Project. This project consists of creating the game, "Rock, Paper, Scissors", that can be played entirely in the browser's console. In addition, functions are created so then "rock", "paper", or "scissors" is returned in the console, so then it takes the user choice and returns it, keep track of the players score, and more.
